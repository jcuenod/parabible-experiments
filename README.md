Experiments with alternative tech for parabible clients

**1. Bulma + Vue.js**

https://jcuenod.github.io/parabible-experiments/bulma

Surprisingly easy to get a lot of stuff going pretty rapidly

**2. Cool Widget Manager**

https://jcuenod.github.io/parabible-experiments/docking-ui/dist/index.html

The idea of these widgets is not going to get old soon

**3. Inspect Click Event to Find Word under Cursor**

https://jcuenod.github.io/parabible-experiments/caretFromPosition/index.html

This is an idea to get rid of millions of dom nodes (spans around every bit of a word so that we can figure out which words are being clicked on to look up data for them [or create search terms from them])
